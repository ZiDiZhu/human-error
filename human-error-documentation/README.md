# Human Error

An interactive experience set in a future scenario where a clone person experiences recorded memories of their prototype self in VR.

### Narrative

starts discourses on the subjects of identity, simulation, trauma and death.

Has several chapters, each detailing a specific moments of life of this prototype person.


### Game Design

Very minimal inputs, as this project's focus will be the *cinematics* of each scene.

Requires the user to perform some actions to trigger the next events such as

- click to continue dialogue
- asked to press a specific button or select from a dropdown menu
- navigate (in a 2D or 3D space)
- move the mouse to rotate camera view

### Art direction

Create an atmosphere that's *oddly familiar* (uh I guess for myself at least?)

Use a lot of
- liminal spaces,
- low resolution graphics and
- mute colors.
- Dim-lit scenes and
- unusual skies.

### Music/sound design

Mostly an ost with peaceful melody with muted instruments,
But unusually crisp sound effects?

Sound will be like either MUTED or CRISP
with no in between

- A LoT of flutes and (very crisp) xylophone



this is a vague draft for now
