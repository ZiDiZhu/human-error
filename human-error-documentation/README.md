# human_error
An interactive fiction that speculates a future scenario in which a tech company makes human clones into commercial product.


## Narrative Concept

The player takes on the role of a low-ranking product tester in the tech company whose tasks is to look through the "error logs" of a defective product. The defective product in question is a clone child who was gifted with amazing problem-solving abilities, but deemed to be unfit as a commercial product due to their problematic behaviours. The error logs are pieces of the child's extracted memory. As the product tester, the player experiences the memories in first person. 

The tech company created an operating system called "Dream Interface", directly linking to a person's brain and disconnects the user from the physical reality. This technology allows the human brain to be easily programmable. However, the system is suceptable to hacking. The "defective" child has found a way to hack the interface, and disguise themself as a part of the interface and tries to communicate with the player.
