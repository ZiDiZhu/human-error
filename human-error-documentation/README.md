# Human Error - Draft / ideas / Design Directions

An interactive experience set in a future scenario where a clone person experiences recorded memories of their prototype self in VR.

## Narrative Concept

**It will be a storytelling game with several chapters. The order in which chapters are played is randomly generated. so there is in total x! amount of possibilities where x is the number of chapters. If there were 5 chapters, there'll be 5x4x3x2x1=120 possible sequences**

The several chapters each details a specific moments of life of this prototype person.
They all have relevant/connected information and the player will have to make sense of the story that is out of order.

###Why This Concept?

I want to see how the order in which events are told in a story would affect its tone / feel.

I'm proposing this hypothetical genre/form of a storytelling media called "Chaotic Sequence" where parts of a story can be told in any and every order. So each time you read the story it'll be unique (most likely).

ok it's basically like shuffling an album... but I haven't seen any shows / story / narrative games that has this "shuffle" mechanic so I think I'd attempt it. 


## Game Design

Very minimal inputs, as this project's focus will be the *cinematics* of each scene.

Requires the user to perform some actions to trigger the next events such as

- click to continue dialogue
- asked to press a specific button or select from a dropdown menu
- navigate (in a 2D or 3D space)
- move the mouse to rotate camera view

## Art direction

Create an atmosphere that's *oddly familiar* (uh I guess for myself at least?)

Use a lot of
- liminal spaces,
- low resolution graphics and
- mute colors.
- Dim-lit scenes and
- unusual skies.

## Music/sound design

Mostly an ost with peaceful melody with muted instruments,
But unusually crisp sound effects?

Sound will be like either MUTED or CRISP
with no in between

- A LoT of flutes and (very crisp) xylophone



this is a vague draft for now
